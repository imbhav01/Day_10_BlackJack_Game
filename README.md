## Day 10 - Black Jack

This Project is prepared by using basic python loops and functions, showcasing a positive approach towards game development.

This project showcases the usage of the python strings, loops, ASCII arts, interactive programming, importing modules in Python and a beginner friendly approach towards game developement in python.

I am learning these things from a udemy course.

So, I hope you guys like it !

# Instructions

### How to play
- Enter your chosen stake (bet) for the round. This can be changed each round and the default stake is Â£5.00 (if you don't enter anything or enter something that isn't a number).
- You will be told the dealers first card and dealt your first 2 cards, as well as told their total after each card so you don't have to keep track (face cards are worth 10, aces are 1 or 11 at the players choice).
- You will then get a set options, which you choose from to try and get your total as close to, but not exceeding 21.
  - Hit - receive another card 
  - Stand - stick with the cards you have
  - Double down - double your stake and get dealt one final card which you automatically stand one (only available immediately after you are dealt your first 2 cards).
  - Split - Split your 2 cards into 2 seperate hands that are played 1 by 1, doubling your stake to put the originals stake on each one. Dealer only plays once and both hands are compared against the same one (only available immediately after you are dealt your first 2 cards, and only if both cards are the same).
- If you go over 21 at any point you are bust and lose.
- Once you stand, or reach exactly 21, the dealer will play, and you win if you score higher than the dealer.
  - The dealer has to stand on a hard (no aces) 17 or above, and has to take another card on soft (at least 1 ace) 17 or lower
- If you are closer to 21, but not over, than the dealer than you win and get your money back plus the same as a reward.
  - If you get BlackJack (an ace and a king), then you get your stake back as well as 1.5x back as a reward.
